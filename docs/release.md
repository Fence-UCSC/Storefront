# Release Plan
## Storefront (v1.0) by *Fence* 
Release date: Dec. 2016

### High level goals
The final goal is to build a ecommerce platform for people to trade peer-to-peer locally and easily. As a seller, he/she just have to post their location and products information to our platform. Simultaneously, those information can also be shared to other social website, such as, facebook and instagram. As a purchaser, he/she can easily find out all the local sellers in our platform whenever and wherever. In order to find out the best similar products in the market, the website would provide a rating and review system for the products and the sellers.

### User stories for release
* Sprint 1
 * As an online purchaser, I want to easily find and buy products from people nearby so I don't lose too much time for the task. (Highest priority for Sprint 1). Solution would be to make a website based on the “free for sale” page 
 * As an online buyer/seller, I appreciate not having to make new accounts so I don’t have remember new passwords.
 * As a web user, I appreciate a good UI so I can find what I need quickly. (lowest priority for Sprint 1, but might get bumped down into Sprint 2 if not implemented in Sprint 1)
* Sprint 2
 * As a buyer/seller, I would like a responsive design so I can access my transactions on all my devices. 
 * As a administrator, I need moderation and reviewing tools so I can handle suspicious/spam postings.
* Sprint 3
 * As an online seller, I need a simple way to send out what I am selling to all of my social media accounts so I don’t need to login every time on all my social medias.
 * As an administrator I want to be able to ban users and promote certain postings if needed so the website remains safe to use.
