# Sprint 3 Plan
## Storefront by Fence
Sprint Completed by Wed. Nov 23th

### Goal 
Finish up the minimum spec and iron out bugs, cutting out planned but nonessential functionality if needed

### Task listing, organized by user story
* As an online purchaser. I want to easily find and buy products from people nearby. (Highest priority for Sprint 1). Solution would be to make a website based on the “free for sale” page 
 * Webpage filtered by category
* As an online purchaser, I want to find a store on a map
 * Edit page allowing users to input location using a map
 * User profile page displaying map of current location
 * Filter based on location
* As a administrator, I need moderation and reviewing tools so I can handle suspicious/spam postings. (lowest priority)
 * Being able to delete users and posts as a website admin
* As a buyer/seller, I would like a responsive design so I can access my transactions on all my devices.
 * Update UI for homepage to show grid of images
 * Update UI for product page to show categories
* As an online seller, I need a simple way to send out what I am selling to all of my social media accounts so I don’t need to login every time on all my social medias.
 * Change OAuth provider so we can get more data
