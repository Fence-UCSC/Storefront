# Sprint 1 Plan
## Storefront by Fence
Sprint Completed by Wed. Oct 19th

### Goal 
The final goal is to build a ecommerce platform for people to trade peer-to-peer locally and easily. As a seller, he/she just have to post their location and products information to our platform. Simultaneously, those information can also be shared to other social website, such as, facebook and instagram. As a purchaser, he/she can easily find out all the local sellers in our platform whenever and wherever. In order to find out the best similar products in the market, the website would provide a rating and review system for the products and the sellers.

### Task listing, organized by user story
* Sprint 1
 * As an online purchaser. I want to easily find and buy products from people nearby. (Highest priority for Sprint 1). Solution would be to make a website based on the “free for sale” page 
 * As an online buyer/seller, I appreciate not having to make new accounts.
 * As a web user, I appreciate a good UI  (lowest priority for Sprint 1, but might get bumped down into Sprint 2 if not implemented in Sprint 1)
