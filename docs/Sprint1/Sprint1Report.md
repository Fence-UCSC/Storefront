### Actions to Stop Doing
* We feel like we need to be more productive given the time that we have. In sprint 2 we need to have more specific tasks and be motivated to be working a lot on them.

### Actions to Start Doing
* As stated before, we need to simply be doing more. We also need to meet up in our teams more if we are working in small groups.

### Action to Keep Doing
* We have good meeting pracitces (we meet every MWF) so we should continue that. We also have good communication over social media, email, and Git.
